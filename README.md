# rainbow-lorikeet
~~A community project dedicated to creating a version of Kali Linux's incredible Win-Kex UI for WSL2 that works with Parrot OS in a WSL2 distribution. Includes a WSL2-compatible Parrot Security OS installer.~~


With the new release of WSLg, this isn't going to be super needed anymore, but I'll still work on it; having the same deep level of integration such as the panels and clipboard access would be great, not to mention an installer. This project will be refocused to providing the same result, but with a much similar approach. 

## Description and files
### Rainbow
An executable installer just as you'd find in the Microsoft store that will open a command prompt window and manage the installation process. 

### Lorikeet
The required dependencies depending on the user's configuration, and files required to set up Rainbow Lorikeet.


## Plans
### The Installer
 - [ ] Offers the choice to the user to pick stable, beta, and nightly branches for ParrotOS
 - [ ] Offers the choice to the user to pick home, security, or custom installation 
     - [ ] Custom installation will build off of the home edition, and prompt the user to pick which meta packages for security they wish to install, as well as which home packages they'd like to omit if any
